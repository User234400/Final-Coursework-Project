# Final-Coursework-Project
# ðŸŽ“ Student Management System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This is a simple Java console application for managing student records. It was developed as a coursework project to demonstrate basic programming skills in Java.

The program allows you to:
- Add new students
- View all students
- Delete students by ID
- Generate a simple report with statistics

Data is saved in a text file (`students.txt`) for persistence between sessions.

## ðŸ§  Technologies & Concepts Used

- âœ… Java (basic syntax, classes, methods)
- âœ… File I/O (read/write from `.txt` file)
- âœ… ArrayList for storing student data
- âœ… Scanner for user input
- âœ… Modular code structure with 3 classes
- âœ… Input validation (e.g., checking numbers)
- âœ… Basic error handling (file not found, wrong input)

## ðŸ§¾ Functions Implemented

### ðŸ”¹ `add(Student s)`
Adds a new student to the file.

### ðŸ”¹ `getAll()`
Reads and returns all students from the file.

### ðŸ”¹ `deleteById(String id)`
Removes a student by their unique ID.

### ðŸ”¹ `generateReport()`
Generates summary report:
- Total students
- Average math, science, English grades
- Average attendance

### ðŸ”¹ `fromCSV(String line)`
Converts a line from the file into a `Student` object.

### ðŸ”¹ `toCSV()`
Converts a `Student` object into a line for the file.
